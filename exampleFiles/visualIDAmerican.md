## Objective
I want to build an application that pulls questions from the US citizenship test and allows me to study for the test.
The application should be able to generate a set number of questions based on some inputs from the user such as category and subcategory.
The application should display questions one at a time and allow the user to answer the question.
After all questions are answered, the application should display the user's score and a summary of the questions answered correctly and incorrectly.
Then at the end of the results, there shoudl be a button to restart the quiz and reset the inputs for the questions to be generated.

## Pages
Page 1: the first has inputs for number of questions a user wants to be asked (max 25), a dropdown for category (based on the main categories in the US citizenship exam), and sub categories cooresponding to the main category. Category and sub category can also have an option for "Any". At the bottom is a button that says "Start test"

Page 2: the next page is the test where one question at a time will be displayed. After a user answers a question in the input field, they will click Next and the next question will appear. Each question is numbered and will show how many questions remain. When a user reaches the last question the Next button will instead say "See Results" which will lead to the last page

Page 3: this page will show all the results showing each question with the users answer underneath, and the correct answer + other acceptable answers below. If the user's answer is incorrect, it will highlight the user's answer in red and show the correct answers available.

## Visual Design

A visual will be provided that gives a visual representation of the below description

Muted, cinematic Americana.
Recurring motifs: highways, gas stations, motels, desert expanses, and small-town facades.
Color palette: warm midtones, dusty blues, desaturated reds, and sun-faded yellows—evoking film grain and nostalgia.
Lighting: flat midday light or low golden-hour sun, emphasizing stillness and emptiness.
Mood: isolation, transience, and quiet observation—often with no people, just traces of them.
Composition: centered subjects, wide frames, long perspectives, and minimal motion blur in one photo suggesting travel.
Overall identity: a contemporary reinterpretation of mid-century road-trip photography—Edward Hopper meets Stephen Shore.
